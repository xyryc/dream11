# [DREAM 11](https://dream11.surge.sh)

## Overview
DREAM 11 is an interactive cricket player selection web app built with React. It allows users to select players within a virtual budget, manage selected players, and experience a dynamic interface with real-time notifications and validation. The application is styled to match a Figma design, making it both functional and visually appealing.

## Technologies Used
- **React** for building the UI components.
- **React-Toastify** for enhanced alert notifications.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design based on Figma guidelines.
- **DaisyUI** for faster prototyping.
- **JSON** to manage player data.

## Key Features
1. **Interactive Player Selection**: Select up to 6 players, manage budget constraints, and receive real-time feedback for actions and errors.
2. **Toggle Between Views**: Switch between "Available" and "Selected" players, allowing users to review and manage their team.
3. **Player Management and Validation**: Track player count, prevent duplicate selections, and remove players with ease.
